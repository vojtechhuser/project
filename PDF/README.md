Approach 1.2: Enhance data usability by ensuring that available data are provided
in readily analyzable formats. A substantial barrier noted by stakeholders was that
useful data sources are sometimes provided in formats (e.g., PDF formats) that do not
readily support empirical analyses. Examples include the ARCOS data, as well as state
data made available in a PDF table even though it had originally been created in Excel.
Having to work with such formats creates a cost for researchers, who must translate data
into a format that can be analyzed with statistical programs. The translation creates
unneeded risk of further data-entry errors. For data that are already being made available,
and particularly for data that may already exist in formats that facilitate incorporation into
analytic software, costs to researchers can be reduced by ensuring that data are provided
in files that support analysis in a straightforward way.


# Complex text (alternative to PDF)

Ability to have rich text and tables is important for many documents.

## PubMed Central

Scientific journal articles provide an example of complex text. PubMed Central (PMC) uses epub format as a fully equivalent alternative to PDF. Epub format can be viewed in some internet browsers (e.g., Edge (from Microsoft))

Example EPUB https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4832051/epub/
(same article as PDF https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4832051/pdf/kwv254.pdf )
